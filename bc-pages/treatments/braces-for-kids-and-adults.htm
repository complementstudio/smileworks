<p>Dr. Daron Lind offers the Clear Correct systems as an alternative to traditional braces. Clear tray liners can straighten your teeth using a series of clear, custom, removable aligners. Each aligner moves your teeth just a little bit at a time until your teeth are eventually straight. This can also be a great solution for people who need to move a few of their teeth or correct small issues with their bite.</p>
<p>Busy adults and teens are often worried that braces will interfere with their lives. With clear liners, you can have the straight smile that you have always wanted, without metal braces, and while you keep on doing everything you love to do.</p>
<h3>What conditions can Clear Correct liners correct?</h3>
<p>They are a clear alternative to braces.</p>
<p>Clear teeth aligners have been used to correct:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overcrowded teeth</li>
<li>Crossbite</li>
<li>Overbite</li>
<li>Underbite</li>
<li>Gaps</li>
<li>Spacing</li>
</ul>
<h3>How does the clear tray liner system work?</h3>
<p>Dr. Lind will examine your smile, and determine if Clear Correct will work for you. Next, he will take a scan with Cerec ( No impressions needed). Once lab receives the scan our custom prescription aligners are made and sent back to our office.</p>
<p>About every 2 weeks you&rsquo;ll receive a new set of aligners. The aligners are made of ultra-thin clear plastic and they are barely noticeable. With each new prescription aligner, you&rsquo;ll see progress until your teeth are eventually straight.</p>
