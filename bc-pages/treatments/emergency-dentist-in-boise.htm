<p>Life can be unpredictable. In our experience, the only thing most dental emergencies have in common is that they tend to happen when it is inconvenient to get them handled. </p>
<p>A dental emergency can be the result of an accident or injury, but it can also be the result of needing to get treatment that you have been putting off for a while. If you are hurting or have had an accident, it is important that you receive treatment right away.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, Dr. Lind will do what he can to see you the same day and get you out of pain.</p>
