<p>Dr. Daron Lind offers Clear Correct as his treatment of choice for straightening teeth. Most of our Clear Correct  patients at any given time are adults. Dr. Daron Lind enjoys helping his patients achieve the beautiful, straight smiles that keep their teeth healthy and boost their confidence.
<p>
  <a href="https://clearcorrect.com/" target="_blank">ClearCorrect</a> is the simple, effective way to straighten your teeth, so you can get a smile you’ll love.
</p>
<p>
  Looking for an alternative to metal braces?
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://clearcorrect.com/" target="_blank">ClearCorrect</a> is the clear and simple choice. No wires. No brackets. Just clear, convenient comfort—every reason to smile.
</p>
<p>
  With <a href="https://clearcorrect.com/" target="_blank">ClearCorrect</a>, your dentist or orthodontist can straighten your teeth using a series of clear, custom, removable aligners. Each aligner moves your teeth just a little bit at a time until you eventually get straight teeth.
</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
  You and your doctor will evaluate your teeth and talk about any problems or goals you have for your smile. Once you and your doctor establish <a href="https://clearcorrect.com/" target="_blank">ClearCorrect</a> is the right treatment option for you, your doctor will take impressions, photos, and x-rays of your teeth that <a href="https://clearcorrect.com/" target="_blank">ClearCorrect</a> uses in manufacturing your custom aligners. Then your doctor writes a prescription for your custom aligners and sends it to <a href="https://clearcorrect.com/" target="_blank">ClearCorrect</a>.
</p>
<h2>What can it do?</h2>
<p>
  ClearCorrect can treat a wide variety of issues that keep people from achieving their ideal smiles. Straighter teeth don’t just look better; they work better too. Poorly-aligned teeth can interfere with bite function, wear out quicker, and are more prone to cavities. Ask your doctor how ClearCorrect can help you.
