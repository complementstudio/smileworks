<p>Porcelain veneers are one of the best ways to transform your smile in a short space of time. Done properly, the results we get for our patients are nothing less than spectacular.</p>
<p>Veneers are very thin porcelain facings that Dr. Lind can place on top of your natural teeth to change their shape, color, size and spacing. Veneers can literally transform your smile overnight. Many Hollywood celebrities achieve their dazzling white smiles through the use of veneers.</p>
<p>When you come in for an initial consultation, Dr. Lind will examine your teeth and bite and talk to you about what you hope to accomplish with your smile. He always takes the time to listen so that any treatment is performed with the patient's best interests in mind.</p>
<p>If you do decide to get veneers, Dr. Lind will design each veneer to fit your mouth perfectly so that the end result is a beautiful, natural smile that you will be proud to show off.</p>

<p><em>Speed</em> &ndash; Porcelain Veneers can be used to correct many different problems with teeth, and the whole process can be completed in two or three visits.

<p><em>Strength &amp; Durability</em> &ndash; Veneers made from high-quality porcelain will last for many, many years and will give you the same strength and chewing pressure that you get from your natural teeth.</p>

<p><em>Custom-Fit</em> &ndash; Veneers can be made to match any tooth shape you can imagine. Sometimes just changing the shape or color a few teeth can completely change the way you look and the way you feel about your smile.</p>

<h2>Customizing your Veneers</h2>
<p>
  Dr. Daron Lind may be able to complete your veneers is a SINGLE VISIT utilizing CEREC technology!  This is especially true for single tooth veneer treatment.   Lost, cracked or broken veneers can easily be treated using CEREC in a single visit.  More extensive smile redesigns may take multiple appointments.
</p>

<h3>First Visit &ndash; Consultation</h3>

<p>If a same day CEREC crafted veneer if not appropriate for your case, your first visit is your consultation with Dr. Lind. He will find out what you want to accomplish with veneers and show you examples of his work so that you get a good idea of the smile you can have.</p>
<p>We may also take an impression of you teeth to create wax model of your teeth so that we can show you more precisely how your smile will change when your veneers are made. As soon as Dr. Lind has completed the design and determined the color for your veneers, the specifications are sent to the lab.</p>

<h3>Second Visit &ndash; Temporaries</h3>
<p>On your second visit Dr. Lind will prepare your teeth and put temporary veneers in place. These temporaries are designed to have the same shape and feel as your final veneers, and are not meant to be worn for more than a few weeks. This gives you the opportunity to make sure you like the shape, color and feel of the veneers before the final set is put in place.</p>

<h3>Third Visit &ndash; Your transformation is complete</h3>
<p>The third visit is where the magic happens. Dr. Lind will remove your temporary veneers and permanently bond your new smile into place. The results can be truly life-changing and nothing makes us happier than to see our patients with a new renewed sense of confidence and happiness after a smile makeover</p>
<p>Get your exam and discuss your options and find out if veneers or another cosmetic procedure would be best for you.</p>
