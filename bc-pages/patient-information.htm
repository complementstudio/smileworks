<p>Financial arrangements, including answers to questions about any insurance coverage you might have, are made with our Patient Care Coordinator before any treatment is begun.</p>
<p>We look forward to meeting you. Please arrive at least 15 minutes before your scheduled appointment time.</p>

<h2>Facts About Dental Insurance</h2>
<h3>Fact #1:</h3>

<p>Dental insurance benefits differ greatly from traditional medical health insurance benefits and can vary quite a bit from plan to plan.</p>
