<h3>clinical interest</h3>
<p>I enjoy getting to know my patients, so that I can better understand their specific needs and develop treatment plans that are realistic, prioritized and affordable for them. I am passionate about my patients and having a positive impact on their lives by delivering high quality, comfortable patient centered care. i enjoy treating patients of all ages and backgrounds. One of my major goals is I focus on prevention and control of oral disease (i.e. cavities, gum disease). As a general dentist I enjoy being able to provide comprehensive care such as Oral Surgery, Root Canals, Fillings, Dentures, Crowns, Implants, Briges and Veneers. It is really satisfying to be able to use my skills to help my patients improve their smiles, maintain their quality of life, relieve their pain and see their self-confidence flourish.</p>

<h2>Jeanie</h2>
<h4>Dental Hygentist</h4>
<p>As a native of Idaho I grew up in the Treasure Valley and obtained my Dental Hygiene Degree in 2001 at the American Institute of Health Technology in Boise. I am married and have three grown daughters. I have been working as a dental hygienist at Smileworks since 2005. Through the nearly 10 years at this practice I have gotten to know you and your families and feel like you have included me in countless weddings, pregnancies, graduations, retirements and the passing of loved ones. This has been a very rewarding experience and I would like to thank you for entrusting me in caring for you and your family's oral hygiene needs.</p>
<p>Aside from my work in the dental office I also serve as the Executive Director of a non-profit organization that my husband, Sheriff Kieran Donahue and I started in 2012. The program is a public awareness campaign on the issue of domestic violence. It is called the Man Up Crusade and we bring purple day/night into professional rodeo. The color purple and the purple ribbon is the color of choice for domestic violence victims and survivors. This year, rodeos in seven western states held a Man Up Crusade purple event helping raise over $20,000 for domestic violence shelters in their local community.</p>
<p>When not at work we like to spend time in the outdoors and enjoy horseback riding in the mountains and working cattle on the family's ranch in Mackay, Idaho. I also show horses in American Quarter Horse Association Shows.</p>
<p>Over the past nine years I have seen several changes here at Smileworks but I am most excited about our recent addition of Dr. Lind to the practice. Dr. Lind shares my views on how important dental care is for our patients. He treats each patient individually and puts their needs first. Dr. Lind is certain to provide a warm welcome to you and your family and has excellent communication skills. I am confident he will be able to answer any questions you have.</p>
