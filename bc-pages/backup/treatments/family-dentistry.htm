<h2>Children's Checkups</h2>
<h3>In a thorough check-up, we will help your children learn to care for their own teeth.</h3>
<p>Dr. Lind likes to see children from a very young age. He recommends that you start bringing your children with you to the dentist as soon as their first teeth have grown in. This way they will be accustomed to routine dental treatment when it comes time for their own checkups and cleaning.</p>
<p>We want your child&rsquo;s first visit  to be a happy one where they can come in and get acquainted with the dentist  and office. The doctor will give your child a toothbrush and let him or her  ride up and down the chair and get a good feeling about the place. We want  every kid to have a happy first visit to the dentist. This is at no charge and very  fun for all concerned.</p>

<h2>Dental Sealants</h2>
<h3>Protect your child's teeth against bacteria</h3>
<p><strong>Dr. Lind recommends dental sealants to help keep your children's teeth healthy.</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Lind recommends that parents explore the possibility of using sealants on their children's teeth to prevent tooth decay early on in life.</p>
<p>You can remove most food particles and plaque from your teeth with thorough brushing and flossing. However, there are small depressions and grooves on the chewing surfaces of the back teeth that often get missed.</p>
<p>Dental sealants act as a barrier, protecting the teeth against decay-causing bacteria. In other words, they help prevent dental problems before they start.</p>
<h3>How does a sealant help prevent decay?</h3>
<p>A sealant is a plastic material that is usually applied to the chewing surfaces of the back teeth. This plastic substance bonds into the depressions and grooves of the teeth and acts as a barrier, protecting enamel by "sealing out" plaque and acids.</p>
<h3>Is sealant application a complicated procedure?</h3>
<p>It is easy for us to apply sealants, and it usually takes only a few minutes to seal each tooth. We starts by cleaning each tooth to be sealed, and then roughen up the surface with an acid solution so that the sealant with adhere to the tooth. The sealant is then painted onto the tooth enamel where it bonds directly to the tooth.</p>
<h3>How long does it last?</h3>
<p>As long as the sealant remains intact, the tooth surface will be protected from decay. Sealants hold up well under the force of normal chewing and usually last several years before a reapplication is needed. Dr. Lind will check the condition of the sealants during regular dental check-ups and reapply when necessary.</p>
