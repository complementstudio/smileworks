<h2>Our Root Canal Procedure </h2>
<p>Root canal therapy is a procedure used to save a tooth when the decay has spread down into the root itself. The root becomes infected and this puts pressure on the adjacent teeth and parts of the mouth. Using root canal therapy we can remove the infection and restore the tooth with a crown or an onlay.</p>
<p>Before recommending root canal therapy we collect a thorough history of any symptoms and perform an examination including dental x-rays. This helps us accurately diagnose any tooth that may need root canal therapy.</p>
<p>Our root canals are fast and comfortable. When properly performed, and under normal circumstances, a root canal-treated tooth can last you a lifetime.</p>
