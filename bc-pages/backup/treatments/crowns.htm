</section>
<p>You may need a crown because of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Extensive tooth decay</li>
    <li>Large metal or tooth-colored fillings, that weaken the remaining tooth</li>
    <li>Broken or cracked teeth</li>
    <li>A tooth that has had root canal therapy</li>
    <li>A misaligned or misshaped tooth</li>
    <li>Teeth that have large fillings that are breaking down and cannot be refilled</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes a crown is not the optimum solution and other dental procedures such as porcelain veneers or dental bonding are more appropriate.</p>
