<p>Whitening is perfect for those who want a fast way to get a whiter, brighter smile. In just one visit to our office, we can give you a smile that is up to 10 shades whiter than when you walked in. </p>
<p>Whitening is safe and effective, and is often recommended by Dr. Lind as part of a cosmetic or restorative treatment plan. If you are planning to have other dental work done, such as a crown or a bridge, you may want to consider getting first so that your new crown or restoration will match your beautifully whitened teeth.</p>
<h3>Fast, painless whitening</h3>
<p>The Whitening procedure is <em>simple and painless.</em> Dr. Lind begins with a short preparation to isolate your lips and gums. Next, he activates the Whitening Gel with a specially designed light. A five-minute fluoride treatment completes the procedure. </p>
<p>You'll be amazed with the results. In most cases, teeth get even whiter the first few days after the procedure. With regular cleaning, your whiter smile can sparkle for years.</p>
<p>In addition to the office visit, we also offer a supply of touch-up kits and customized trays. That can add up to a lifetime of bright, white smiles! </p>
