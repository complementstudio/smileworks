<h2>What is a Dental Bridge?</h2>

<p>A bridge is a device used to fill the space left by a missing tooth. First the two teeth on either side of the gap are shaved down. The bridge is custom made to fit on top of those two teeth with a replacement tooth in the middle to fill the gap. </p>
<p>A bridge is not a removable fixture, so once it is in place it will last for many years. It is very important to get a missing tooth or (teeth) replaced using a bridge or implants. Your teeth may shift to accommodate the empty space (which can affect your bite adversely), and the jaw bone will deteriorate if there is nothing there to stimulate it (such as a tooth root or an implant).</p>
<p>A dental bridge is not the only way to replace missing teeth, but sometimes it is more cost effective than a dental implant. Many of Dr. Lind's patients have bridges that have help them smile and chew naturally for years.</p>

<h2>Bridges, Implants or Dentures?</h2>
<p>The most common ways to replace missing teeth are through the use of dental bridges, <a href="/treatments/dental-implants">dental implants</a> and <a href="/treatments/dentures">full or partial dentures.</a></p>
<p>Most of the time we can help a patient with one or more missing teeth without having to resort to dentures. Partial dentures can be a cheaper alternative, and in some cases they can be anchored to a dental implant for increased stability.</p>
<p>The biggest downsides to a bridge are a) that the healthy teeth on either side have to be shaved down to accept the Bridge and b) because there isn't an implant in the bone in place of the missing tooth, there can still be some bone loss or shrinkage.</p>
<p>Dr. Lind often encourages his patients to pursue dental implants as they have rapidly become the new standard of care for replacing missing teeth. He is trained to place the implants right in our office, and can provide you with implant-supported dentures as well as new individual implants to replace one or more missing teeth.</p>
