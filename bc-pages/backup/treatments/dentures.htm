<p>Dr. Daron Lind has been crafting dentures for his patients over 30 years. He offers both full and partial dentures that <strong>fit comfortably</strong> and <strong>stay in place</strong> &mdash; even when you're eating. Dr. Lind is also very experienced in placing dental implants to secure dentures, which makes them even stronger.</p>

<p>Diagnosing the way your teeth and jaw fit together is one Dr. Lind's specialties. He has spent thousands of hours in advanced training to hone his skills in jaw placement, which is one of the most important factors that determines how comfortable your dentures will be.</p>

<h2>Types of Dentures</h2>
<h3>Complete or Full</h3>
<p>Complete dentures are full replacements for all of your teeth. This can be a full set of either upper or lower teeth, or a combined set for your entire mouth.</p>
<h3>Partials</h3>
<p>Partial dentures are designed to correct the gaps in your smile when only some of your teeth are missing.  Metal or tooth-colored attachments anchor the dentures to your natural teeth.</p>
<p>Partial dentures maintain tooth alignment by preventing your remaining teeth from shifting. Partial dentures can also help you prevent further tooth loss due to decay or gum disease.</p>

<h3>Implant-supported dentures</h3>
<p>Over time, people can develop problems with dentures. They can become loose, painful or tend to slip or move around.</p>
<p>Dr. Lind can prevent these problems by creating a custom set of dentures for you that will stay put. They are attached to and supported by dental implants.</p>

<h2>Dentures vs. Dental Implants</h2>
<p>If you are missing teeth and considering dentures, be sure to ask Dr. Lind about dental implants. Dental implants feel and function just like your natural teeth and are a popular alternative to removable dentures. They are permanent replacement teeth that are affixed to titanium posts anchored into the jawbone. Read more about <a href="/our-treatments/dental-implants">Dental Implants.</a></p>
<p>Typically, removable dentures need to be replaced every 7 to 15 years, compared to an average 25 year life span for dental implants. Dr. Lind can go over the pros and cons of dentures and dental Implants with you and recommend the solution that will work best.</p>
