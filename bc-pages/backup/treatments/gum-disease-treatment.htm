<h2>Effective treatment for Gingivitis</h2>
<p>Proper treatment of Gum Disease is one of the most important services we offer at Smileworks Dental. We have a very experienced team of hygienists who are all well trained to locate and treat gum disease before it spreads into its advanced stages.</p>
<p>Gum Disease is much more prevalent than you may think. Many people don't get their gums treated until after the bacteria has spread and formed deep pockets, which can have an adverse affect on their overall health.
</p>
<h3>Gum Disease and your health</h3>
<p>Recent studies have shown a link between harmful bacteria that can develop in your mouth and other more serious health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>On the positive side, we check for and treat gum disease t every checkup. So as long as you stay on track with your routine cleanings, your risk of developing serious problems with gum disease become quite low.

<h2>Treatment for Mild to Moderate Gum Disease</h2>
<p>If the dentist diagnoses any gum disease, one of our hygienists will treat it, usually on the same day.  Mild to moderate cases are treated with deep cleaning (scaling and root planing), followed by the application of Arestin dental antibiotic to root out any bacteria hiding deep in the gums. </p>
<p>A follow up visit is recommended to ensure that your gums remain disease free. Most cases can be treated right here at our office, but some more advanced cases might be referred to a periodontist for further treatment.</p>

<h2>How we help you stop gum disease</h2>
<h3>Arestin&reg;</h3>
<p>After periodontal cleaning, we use Arestin dental antibiotic powder. The Arestin powder is placed inside infected areas of the gums . Arestin ensures that no bacteria remain in the area, and fights against bacteria that might enter the periodontal pockets. </p>
<h3>Symptoms of Gum Disease</h3>
<p>There are a number of factors that contribute to gum disease. Some of these can include poor oral hygiene, not getting regular dental cleanings, smoking or chewing tobacco, certain medications, defective fillings, crooked teeth and other illnesses that are bacterial in nature.</p>
<p>Some warning signs of gum disease include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Gums that bleed during tooth brushing</li>
    <li>Gums that have pulled away from the teeth</li>
    <li>Persistent bad breath or bad taste</li>
    <li>Permanent teeth that are loose or separating</li>
    <li>Any change in the way your teeth fit together when you bite </li>
</ul>
<p>A healthy lifestyle, regular brushing and flossing, and regular visits to the dentist for cleanings are the best way to keep your gums healthy and to avoid gum disease.</p>

<h2>What is gum disease and what causes it?</h2>

<p class="caption">Our hygienists are very gentle and thorough when it comes to treating Gum Disease.</p>
</section>
<p>Gum disease is caused by bacteria in your mouth. When the gums are healthy, they are tight, pink, do not bleed when they are gently probed, and there is little space between the gums and the teeth for bacteria to build up.</p>
<p>If the bacteria are not removed effectively, the first stage of gum disease is that your gums can start to bleed and may become red and swollen (gingivitis). This may not be easily visible, especially in between and around the back teeth, but the space between the gums and teeth becomes bigger. The bacteria then have somewhere to hide and grow.</p>
<p>As the space (pocket) deepens, the bacteria become more aggressive. Your body starts to fight this infection. The combination of the bacteria and your body's response to them leads to a loss of the bone that supports the teeth. This is the more advanced stage of gum disease, also known as "periodontitis".</p>
<p>Therefore, the most important thing to do is correctly diagnose the presence and severity of gum disease. We test your gums for signs of gum disease and severity and then make an appropriate plan to prevent the spread and progression of the disease.</p>
