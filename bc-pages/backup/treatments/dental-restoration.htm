<h2>Restoring your smile to full health and beauty</h2>

<p>An exam starts with a discussion of what you want to fix or change about your smile. Dr. Lind will want to make sure he understands what is important to you before recommending treatment.</p>
<p>Part of the exam will include a panoramic x-ray, which is a type of image that shows Dr. Lind your entire mouth and jaw. It is this kind of technology that enables him to see the full picture and make sure that your treatment includes only the services that you need.</p>
<p>Depending on the procedures that are going to be involved, Dr. Lind may take a wax impression of your teeth, and create a working model of what he expects that your smile will look like after reconstruction. You will review this model with Dr. Lind, and decide what you would like to have your smile look like. The choice will always be up to you.</p>
