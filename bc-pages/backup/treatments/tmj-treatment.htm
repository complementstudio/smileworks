<p>Temporomandibular Joint Disorder or TMJ Syndrome, is an umbrella term covering a variety of conditions associated with the inflammation of the Temporomandibular Joint, which connects the lower jaw to the skull. Dysfunction of this joint can cause significant pain and damage.</p>

    <li>Numbness in arms and fingers</li>

<h2>TMJ diagnosis and treatment</h2>
<p>As part of your patient exam, Dr. Lind will perform a thorough examination to determine if you are experiencing any misalignment of the jaw or teeth that is causing you  difficulties.</p>
<p>Because TMJ is frequently caused by a bad bite, Dr. Lind will first stabilize your bite. In many cases this can be done by using a customized bite guard, a temporary plastic device that fits over your teeth. Once the bite is stabilized, long-term management can begin.</p>
<p>There are many ways to keep your bite in proper alignment. Some permanent solutions may include; reshaping the enamel of the teeth, installing permanent bite guard devices, or installing reconstructive crowns. The most important thing is to get it looked at by a competent practitioner who will work with you to completely handle the problem.</p>
