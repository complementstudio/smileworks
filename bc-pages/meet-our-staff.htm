<h3>clinical interest</h3>
<p>
  I want to be your favorite dentist ever! I enjoy getting to know my patients, so that I can better understand their specific needs and develop treatment plans that are realistic, prioritized and affordable for them. I am passionate about my patients and having a positive impact on their lives by delivering high quality, comfortable patient centered care. I enjoy treating patients of all ages and backgrounds. One of my major goals is to focus on prevention and control of oral disease (i.e. cavities, gum disease). As a general dentist I enjoy being able to provide comprehensive care such as Oral Surgery, Root Canals, Fillings, Dentures, Crowns, Implants, Bridges and Veneers. It is really satisfying to be able to use my skills to help my patients improve their smiles, maintain their quality of life and overall health, relieve their pain and see their self-confidence flourish.

<h2>Jeanie</h2>
<h4>Dental Hygentist</h4>
<p>As a native of Idaho I grew up in the Treasure Valley and obtained my Dental Hygiene Degree in 2001 at the American Institute of Health Technology in Boise. I am married and have three grown daughters. I have been working as a dental hygienist at Smileworks since 2005. Through the nearly 11 years at this practice I have gotten to know you and your families and feel like you have included me in countless weddings, pregnancies, graduations, retirements and the passing of loved ones. This has been a very rewarding experience and I would like to thank you for entrusting me in caring for you and your family's oral hygiene needs.</p>

<p>Aside from my work in the dental office I also serve as the Executive Director of a non-profit organization that my husband, Sheriff Kieran Donahue and I started in 2012. The program is a public awareness campaign on the issue of domestic violence. It is called the Man Up Crusade and we bring purple day/night into professional rodeo. The color purple and the purple ribbon is the color of choice for domestic violence victims and survivors. This year, rodeos in seven western states held a Man Up Crusade purple event helping raise over $20,000 for domestic violence shelters in their local community.</p>

<p>When not at work we like to spend time in the outdoors and enjoy horseback riding in the mountains and working cattle on the family's ranch in Mackay, Idaho. I also show horses in American Quarter Horse Association Shows.</p>

<p>Over the past nine years I have seen several changes here at Smileworks but I am most excited about our recent addition of Dr. Lind to the practice. Dr. Lind shares my views on how important dental care is for our patients. He treats each patient individually and puts his or her needs first. Dr. Lind is certain to provide a warm welcome to you and your family and has excellent communication skills. I am confident he will be able to answer any questions you have.</p>

<h2>Ashley</h2>
<h4>Dental Assistant</h4>
<p>
  I have 7 years of experience working in the dental field. I joined the Smileworks team in 2014 and I continue to be excited to bring my energy and passion for making a difference in your smiles and overall health! My role is to make your visit as comfortable as possible so please let me know how I can accommodate you.</p>
<p>I love spending time with my two children, wonderful husband and my dog. I love the outdoors, riding four wheelers, and horseback riding.</p>

<h2>Jaimie</h2>
<h4>Office Manager</h4>
<p>As the office manager, my role is to ensure your experience while in our care, is of the highest quality. From the moment you schedule your appointment to the time you check out I want you to feel and know how much we respect and value your time and oral health. There are many dental offices here in the neighborhood but we want to stand out as the ONE that you return to with your family and friends because Dr. Lind and his team truly care about you.</p>
<p>Outside of the office I spend most of my time shuttling our girls around to and from dance, gym and soccer activities. Before I had children I was an elementary teacher and literacy specialist so I still try to get my "teacher fix" by volunteering in their classrooms as often as possible.</p>
<p>I have been blessed with Dr. Lind in my life for 20 years and can tell you without a doubt he is the kindest most patient and easygoing dentist in town. I invite you to come in and see for yourself the pride he takes in creating a treatment plan that is specifically designed with your needs in mind.</p>

<h2>Vernesa</h2>
<h4>Patient Care Coordinator</h4>
<p>I have close to 10  years of experience in the dental field. I have been a dental assistant for 5 years and have worked at the front office ever since.  I love everything about the dental field. I love explaining any clinical or insurance questions our patients may have to the best of my knowledge. I have a very bubbly personality.</p>
<p>I enjoy going to the gym and training. It is definitely my passion and it gives me energy and most importantly keeps me healthy. I enjoy outdoors, hiking, camping and just about anything that involves being active. I also love spending time with my husband and both of our families. I do enjoy having one lazy day a week, watching movies all day, prepping food for the week and just taking it easy. My Boxer ( Rosie) is our little furry kid and is always there to greet me and get hair all over me. But most importantly,  she is a big part of our family.</p>
